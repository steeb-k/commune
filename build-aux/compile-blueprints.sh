#
# This should be a temporary solution to fix an incompatibility between our
# setup, blueprint-compiler and meson.
#
# The problem is that blueprint advises to use `custom_target()` with `output`
# set to `.`: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/blueprint-compiler/-/blob/70f32dc069c3ff13a54f24f24c0e720b938f587d/docs/setup.rst#L55
# This doesn't work well with ninja's caching, as it doesn't know which files
# are actually generated, so it might consider that the output is generated too
# soon, and proceed to compiling the gresource before all blueprint files are
# actually compiled.
#
# The fix for this is to actually set the proper list of generated files for the
# output. This doesn't work with our setup because we generate files in
# subdirectories and `custom_target`'s `output` only accepts a list of files in
# the current directory.
#
# So we have 2 options to fix this:
#
# 1. Use a `meson.build` file per subdirectory to compile the blueprints
#    separately which is tedious and results in a lot of duplication.
# 2. Keep our current setup and find a way to generate a list of outputs that is
#    accepted by meson.
#
# For simplicity, we want to use the second option and it would be easy if we
# could use `generator()` to compile the blueprints. It requires
# `gnome.compile_resources()` to accept a `generated_list` in `dependencies`,
# but it doesn't: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/12336.
#
# So this implements another solution: compile all the UI files in the same
# directory by using a name scheme that avoids collisions. Then we can overwrite
# the path where the resource will be available in the gresource file
# definition by setting an `alias`.
#
# The output files will be located in `OUTPUT_DIR` and their names are the
# path of `INPUT_FILE` relative to the `BASE_INPUT_DIR` with the slashes
# replaced by `-`, and the extension changed.

# blueprint-compiler is a Python program, and it opens the `.blp` files without
# naming an encoding, so Python uses the one the locale implies. On Windows that
# is cp1252, and every blueprint with a typographic quote or an accent in it
# fails to decode — reported as a compiler crash, several screens from the cause.
# UTF-8 mode makes `open()` mean UTF-8 regardless of locale. It is a no-op where
# the locale was already UTF-8, which is everywhere else.
